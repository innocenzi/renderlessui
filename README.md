# Renderless Ui

Renderless Ui is a set of Vue components, totally unstyled.

- :warning: This is alpha quality, I'm experimenting differents things.

My target is to delivers high quality components which can be used in various vue/nuxt projects with your favorite css framework without making any design choice for you

You'll find at the root of the organization a github project with my backlog and the next targets

# Why did I start this project ?

I'm working with vue/nuxt since 2 years, basically all of my projects where based on Vuetify which is incredible for a lot of use cases...
But, now I'm in front of another challenge, **give to Vue developers the possibility to get the best of Vue.js without making any design choice for them** it's something really new in our ecosystem (today there is only [headlessUI](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui) which try to reach that goal).

In my opinion this goal could be reach, only if I put a huge effort on documentation and examples with various css fw/homemade css... And with others side projects which are in mind for months, we will see if they'll see the sun rising :D
