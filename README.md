# Renderless Ui

Renderless Ui is a set of Vue components, totally unstyled.

- :warning: This is alpha quality, I'm experimenting differents things.

My goal is to delivers high quality components which can be used in various vue/nuxt projects with your favorite css framework.
**We don't make any design choice for you**

You'll find a github project [here](https://github.com/orgs/renderlessui/projects/1) with the backlog

# Why did I start this project ?

I'm working with vue/nuxt since 2 years, all of my projects are based on Vuetify which is incredible for a lot of use cases...
But, now I'm in front of another challenge, **give to Vue developers the possibility to get the best of Vue.js without make any design choice** it's something really new in our ecosystem (today there is only [headlessUI](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui) which try to reach that goal).

In my opinion this goal could be reach if I put a huge effort on documentation and examples with various css framework/homemade css...
